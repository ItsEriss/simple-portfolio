# simple-portfolio
idk... I made this because I was confused about what project to make next. Maybe this can be called a template and you all can reuse this template for anything.

# Installation
just clone or download or fork the repo and open index.html

```cli
git clone https://github.com/JastinXyz/discord-bot-landing-page-web
```

Replace all required text
